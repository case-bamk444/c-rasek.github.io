        <h2>Something Classic</h2>
        <p><em>Friends</em> is easily my all-time favorite sitcom. I turn it on anytime I want comfort because there's something about the show that makes me feel like life maybe isn't so bad. This scene in particular lives rent-free in my head 24/7.</p>

        <h2>Something Relatable</h2>
        <p>The older I get, the more I relate to Squidward. The following video is actual footage of me trying to survive last semester:</p>

        <h2>Something Nostalgic</h2>
        <p>I've always appreciated Sam's (Jennette McCurdy) literal savageness in the TV show, <em>iCarly</em>. This was peak humor for me when I was a ten-year-old.</p>
